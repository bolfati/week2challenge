# Bijan's Resume Website

## Description

This website was made using my knowledge of HTML and CSS to provide an easy and accessible way to see who I am, my previous work, future work when updated, and contact information.  This is an easy way for future employers to see projects I've worked on.  

## Table of Contents (Optional)

This website includes clickable links to work I've done, will do, and to contact information through the navigation menu and clickable images. 

## Usage

Assets2\bijanportfolio.png

This is where you can see me and my portfolio. 

## Credits

Worked alongside fellow students Jason Mason and Cody Thompson on this project as we develop our mastery with HTML and CSS together.
